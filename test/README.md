## Test directory
This directory contains dummy device for mockup of classes and functions from Arduino for test purposes only in GitHub CI.
The codes in this directory are intended for g++ manual compile and run test in GitHub CI for code coverage calculation with CodeCov.io (https://codecov.io/gh/deltakiloromeo/LCD_VU).

GitHub CI actions scripts are kept in directory .github\workflows as YAML files.
